# netverif

An attempt to implement a formal verification tool for network protocols specification (mostly looking for vulnerabilities, e.g. [CVE-2008-4609](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2008-4609)).

## Design principles of reliable data transfer protocols

1. error detection and correction
2. aknowledgements
3. automatic repeat request
4. sequence numbers
5. timeouts
